All of the jump starters tested were requested by viewers after the round 1 video.  Jump starters bench tested for peak cranking amps.  Then jump starters used on pickup truck with a V6 engine with a drained battery.  Jump starters used to jump start a 4.2-liter diesel tractor with jump starters at ambient as well as after jump starters were placed inside of a freezer set to 0F or -18C.  Finally, all of the jump starters were tested for total watt hour capacity when used as a power bank.  To ensure an unbiased and fair review, I don’t accept sponsorships or free items.

Each type of fastener is tested 7 times and the highest and lowest strengths for each fastener is \"thrown out\".  The types of nails include 16D coated, uncoated, galvanized, spiral shank, and ring shank.  The types of screws include 3.5 inch drywall and coated deck screws. Shear strength is not tested in this video, only pull-out or holding strength.  Highly recommend following applicable building and construction codes when building structures.

I'm not part of the Amazon Affiliate Program either, since I'm not trying to sell products. I do independent testing only.  So, thank you very much for the video ideas, including this one! AmazonBasics Fully Synthetic Motor Oil better than Mobil 1 Advanced Full Synthetic Motor Oil?  In this video, I tested Valvoline 10W-30 Conventional Motor Oil, AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor OIl, and Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor oil for cold temperature flow, lubricity, evaporative loss after exposure to approximately 400F for 2 hours, and cold flow of each oil after exposed to heat for 2 hours.  Finally, while I don't have a shop full of expensive oil testing equipment, the testing approach I use helps provide good information on the quality of these oil products.

Project Farm LLC \n\nDISCLAIMER: The testing methods outlined in this video are my own not performed using expensive oil lab testing equipment or following the ASTM, SAE or API testing standards. This is a showdown between AmazonBasics full synthetic motor oil and Mobil 1 full synthetic motor oil. The VALVOLINE motor oil used in this experiment is CONVENTIONAL motor oil, NOT SYNTHETIC. The use of the Valvoline conventional motor oil is to illustrate the benefits of that synthetic engine oil has over conventional motor oil. Why buy a conventional motor oil when you can purchase a synthetic motor oil which will outperform conventional oil for around the same price or a little more? The three tests outlined in the video include tests for viscosity at varying temperatures, film strength, and evaporative testing. In my opinion, the testing approaches used in this video provide consumers with valuable information on choosing the right motor oil for their specific application."

Each of these products is tested to determine if it is able to prevent phase separation and whether or not it prevents ice from forming in the fuel once there is water contamination.  Additionally, each additive is tested to determine if it will melt ice if ice has already formed in the fuel system before the additive is used.  Additionally, each product is then added to an engine that is already running to see if the engine will continue running normally without using the choke or if the engine will stop running altogether.

        "text": "How will Head & Shoulders perform as an engine oil substitute? There have been hundreds of comments suggesting that Head & Shoulders, a “high viscosity, zinc” shampoo, will beat any oil additive or oil product on the lubricity tester.  In this video, I compare Head & Shoulders to Bestline, since I have some of this product available. I could have included many other additives, including MotorKote, which is equally, if not more impressive than Bestline on the lubricity tester.  Additionally, Head & Shoulders was compared to 10W-30 motor oil at -20F to assess flow characteristics in arctic conditions.  Finally, Head & Shoulders was used in an engine to determine how it performs as an engine oil substitute. Will this high viscosity, zinc-filled shampoo demonstrate superior lubrication and heat dissipating characteristics?  Will it also reduce internal friction, a common characteristic of zinc-based lubricants?  Let’s find out! Hope you enjoy the video!

Zippo claims to be “clean burning” and “fast ignition” and it proved to be just that, even though it’s obviously meant to provide those qualities for “lighters”, not gasoline engines.  Even in the “see through” engine, the fuel demonstrated a beautiful blue flame color.
